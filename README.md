simple-mobile-first-grid
========================

A non-bloated simple mobile first css grid for creating new projects. Supports Internet Explorer 8+ and latest browsers

Please check the index.html for a sample of the grid.

Main idea behind this grid is to keep the containers with no styling except for the width and let them just stack. While the child elements are a the modules that take up the space in the layout.
This way you can ensure your modules are always a 100% and can fluidly adapt to your layout.

A one page demo for a random theme.
