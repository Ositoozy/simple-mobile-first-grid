#Flexy-grid
========================

A non-bloated simple mobile first css grid for creating new projects. Supports Internet Explorer Edge and others.

Please check the index.html for a sample of the grid. As I am horrible at open source documentation :P. I will get back to this soon

NOTE: There are no-css prefixes as browsers are currently stepping away from this idea. If you want to have the grid prefixed, feel free to use any build tool that will concat your css.
